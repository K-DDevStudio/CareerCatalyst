We recommend using the latest version of the software, as it is the only one actively supported.

You are encouraged to regularly test your software and frequently update to the latest versions after ensuring your tests pass. This way, you'll benefit from the latest features, bug fixes, and **security patches**.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've found a vulnerability, even if you're unsure, please report it as soon as possible by sending an email to: security@careercatalyst.com. Please be as detailed as possible, including steps and example code to reproduce the security issue.
